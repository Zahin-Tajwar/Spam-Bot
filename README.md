## Spam-Bot

It's just another simple program written in python. It takes a text as input and continuously types it and presses enter.
So, it can be used to spam.

**Warning:** As it presses enter, sometimes it can be dangerous. **For examle:** Suppose there is a window open that says,"Do you want to delete this file permently?" and you don't want to press "Ok". At that time, if this program is running then this program will press <enter>, that means, "Ok".

Instructions:
- Run the main.py file.
- Enter the text you want to type.
- Open the window on which you want to type the text **As soon as possible(In 5 seconds)**
